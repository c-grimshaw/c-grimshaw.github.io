    <h1>charlie grimshaw</h1>

    <p>
      hi there ðŸ‘‹ i'm charlie grimshaw, a naval + software engineer. i
      work full-time as a system security engineer in the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/navy.html">rcn</a>,
      and moonlight as a data engineer. given the choice, you'll mostly likely find me futzing around in {.go, .rs, .py}
      files.
    </p>

    <p>
      i got my master's in software engineering from rmc, where i was supervised by
      <a href="https://lachine.segfaults.net">brian lachine</a> in my work on anomalous network connection detections
      with sysmon + link prediction techniques. i completed this work with help from deloitte's incredible
      managed detection and response team.
    </p>

    <p>
      my professional experiences are less <em>swe</em> and a bit more <em>naval officer</em>. i've deployed on three
      int'l operations across several countries, and led some amazing teams of people. among
      several projects, i developed <a href="https://github.com/c-grimshaw/gosniff">gosniff</a> in my spare time,
      which is a tui-esque implementation of tcpdump with a little more user interactivity out-of-the-box.
    </p>

    <p>
      in my spare time, you'll catch me chasing after my wonderful fiancÃ©e (<a
        href=" https://olympic.ca/team-canada/erin-teschuk/">...and never catching
        her</a>), or putting in serious hours <a href="https://equator.ca/pages/westboro-cafe">at my favourite local
        cafÃ©</a>.
    </p>
