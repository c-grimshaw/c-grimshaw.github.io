hi there ðŸ‘‹ i'm charlie, a naval + software engineer. i work full-time as a
system security engineer in the {{< link "https://www.canada.ca/en/navy.html"
>}}rcn{{< /link >}}, and moonlight as a data engineer. you'll probably 
find me futzing around in {{{< link "https://go.dev" >}}.go{{< /link >}}, {{<
link "https://www.rust-lang.org" >}}.rs{{< /link >}}, {{< link
"https://www.python.org" >}}.py{{< /link >}}} files.

i got my master's in software engineering from rmc, where i was supervised by
{{< link "https://lachine.segfaults.net" >}}brian lachine{{< /link >}} in my
work on anomalous network connection detection with {{< link
"https://espace.rmc.ca/jspui/handle/11264/1322" >}}sysmon + link prediction
techniques{{< /link >}}. i completed this research with assistance from
deloitte's incredible managed detection and response team.

my professional experiences are colourful, punctuated by over a decade of
military service. i've deployed on three int'l operations across several
countries, and led impactful teams of brilliant people in challenging operating
environments. i also developed {{< link "https://github.com/c-grimshaw/gosniff"
>}}gosniff{{< /link >}}, which is a tui-esque implementation of tcpdump with a
bit more user interactivity out-of-the-box.

you'll find me chasing after my wonderful fiancÃ©e ({{< link
"https://olympic.ca/team-canada/erin-teschuk/" >}}...and never catching her{{<
/link >}}), or putting in serious hours {{< link
