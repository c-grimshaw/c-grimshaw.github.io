hi there ðŸ‘‹ i'm charlie, a naval + software engineer. i work full-time as a system security engineer in the
[rcn](https://www.canada.ca/en/navy.html), and moonlight as a data engineer. you'll mostly likely find
me futzing around in {[.go](https://go.dev), [.rs](https://www.rust-lang.org), [.py](https://www.python.org)} files.

i got my master's in software engineering from rmc, where i was supervised by
[brian lachine](https://lachine.segfaults.net) in my work on anomalous network connection detection
with [sysmon + link prediction techniques](https://espace.rmc.ca/jspui/handle/11264/1322). i completed
this research with assistance from deloitte's incredible managed detection and response team.

my professional experiences are colourful, punctuated by over a decade of military service. i've deployed on three
int'l operations across several countries, and led impactful teams of brilliant people in challenging
operating environments. notably, i developed [gosniff](https://github.com/c-grimshaw/gosniff), which is
a tui-esque implementation of tcpdump with a bit more user interactivity out-of-the-box.

in my spare time, you'll find me chasing after my wonderful fiancÃ©e ([...and never catching
her](https://olympic.ca/team-canada/erin-teschuk/)), or putting in serious hours [at my favourite local
cafÃ©](https://equator.ca/pages/westboro-cafe).
